                            While I'm happy with the design for my portfolio for now, I'm most likely going
                            to change it. I want to make the user interface a little more intuitive, add
                            animations and all that fun stuff. I also plan to continue to work on this page
                            for a while, constantly updating it as I go. I've always been comfortable with webpage
                            design, and this course is just making me even more comfortable. We've finished
                            the user interface unit now, and I hope to get a good knowledge of Javascript from
                            the course after this.

                            I'm excited for this course as I've always had an interest in web page design,
                            and actually maintain a personal website on my spare time. I'm especially excited
                            to learn Javascript, as it is the language used by the RPG Maker engine for their
                            scripts systems, which is something I've been meaning to sit down and learn for
                            months now. I'm hoping to leave this course with more web design skills than I
                            already have, as well as enough knowledge of Javascript to effectively code for
                            RPG Maker. My one worry about this course is that we're going to have a teacher
                            change halfway through. I fear it may make my mark drop if I don't get on well
                            with the new teacher.
