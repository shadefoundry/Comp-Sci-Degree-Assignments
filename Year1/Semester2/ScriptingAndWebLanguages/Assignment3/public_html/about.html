                    I have around 4 years of experience with HTML and CSS, though none
                    with Javascript or SQL. Every web page that I've designed has been built
                    from the ground up, with no use of design software, though I do like to
                    use Adobe Dreamweaver only for its split view of the code and the live site.
                    Through High School, I took all of the Computer Science and Computer Engineering
                    courses, both of which featured a unit of HTML and CSS. I also took a graphic
                    design course, in which I designed a website as my final project. I have no job
                    experience involving web design.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    I have 3 years of programming experience. As mentioned previously, I took
                    all the computer courses in high school. The languages I know are C, Turing and
                    Python, although I do not consider Turing a real language as it is practically
                    useless as a programming language.
