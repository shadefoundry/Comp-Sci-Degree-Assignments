Website designed by Kevin Lopez. I was not given any type of requirement for
how the actual site had to look, just what it had to contain, so I decided to
design it in the theme of "90s Webpage". Everything is hand crafted to be as
close to the actual web pages from the 90s as possible.

Tools Used for Reference:
-The Wayback Machine, looking at sites that I normally follow (ign.com, etc.)
-Random browsing from Angelfire.com, since that site's full of crap from
the early 90s.
-The Buzz Feed article, "How to create the perfect 90s website"

Enjoy!

<div id="experience"><p class="Nineties">I'm excited for this course as I've always had an interest in web page design,
    and actually maintain a personal website on my spare time. I'm especially excited
    to learn Javascript, as it is the language used by the RPG Maker engine for their
    scripts systems, which is something I've been meaning to sit down and learn for
    months now. I'm hoping to leave this course with more web design skills than I
    already have, as well as enough knowledge of Javascript to effectively code for
    RPG Maker. My one worry about this course is that we're going to have a teacher
    change halfway through. I fear it may make my mark drop if I don't get on well
    with the new teacher.</p></div>

    <div id="thoughts">
        <p class="Nineties">I have around 4 years of experience with HTML and CSS, though none
    with Javascript or SQL. Every web page that I've designed has been built
    from the ground up, with no use of design software, though I do like to
    use Adobe Dreamweaver only for its split view of the code and the live site.
    Through High School, I took all of the Computer Science and Computer Engineering
    courses, both of which featured a unit of HTML and CSS. I also took a graphic
    design course, in which I designed a website as my final project. I have no job
    experience involving web design.</p>
        <p class="Nineties">I have 3 years of programming experience. As mentioned previously, I took
    all the computer courses in high school. The languages I know are C, Turing and
    Python, although I do not consider Turing a real language as it is practically
    useless as a programming language.</p></div>
